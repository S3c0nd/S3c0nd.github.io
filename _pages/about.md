I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, under the guidance of Professor Xinda Wang. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree from UESTC.  
My current research focuses on artificial intelligence in software security, and I am always eager to engage in in-depth discussions or collaborations with peers in the field.
